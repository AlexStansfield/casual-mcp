# Casual MCP

The starter aim of this was to create a package that would:
[x] allow me to easily add multiple MCP servers.
[x] handle tool calls from the LLM
[x] configuration support for multiple models over differnt providers
[x] Add OpenAI Provider
[x] include some basic MCP servers
[ ] Support a final response model allowing handling of tools done by another model
[ ] Add Ollama Provider
[ ] Include an API for quick testing 

Further aims:
* Add a "tuner" to allow you to test multiple LLMs to find the best at handling tools
* Add MCP Servers (perhaps a separate packge):
 * Weather
 * Improved Date and Time
 * Brave Search
 * Movies
 * Music
